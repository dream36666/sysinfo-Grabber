This is a tool to gather system information on a target computer.
So far it can grab the os, os version, kernel, hostname, username, ip, mac, cpu, mem free, mem total.
It will also grab history and the things needed to decode the history from Chrome, Chromium, And FireFox.

In the future it will be disgused as a .exe file, will work on Windows, and Mac, (It currently only grabs data from Linux), Send the files to a diffrent computer, Then destroy its self.

I also hope for it to be able to auto detect the operating system the computer is on and work as just one main file in the future.
